Flow Control in Java

Flow Control Defines the way code is executed.
In Java it can be implemented with the following mechanisms:
 - if statements
 - for-loops
 - while-loops
 - switch statements

The switch stement

"Unlike if-then and if-then-else statements, the switch statement can have a number of possible execution paths. A switch works with the byte, short, char, and int primitive data types. It also works with enumerated types (discussed in Enum Types), the String class, and a few special classes that wrap certain primitive types: Character, Byte, Short, and Integer (discussed in Numbers and Strings).

The following code example, SwitchDemo, declares an int named month whose value represents a month. The code displays the name of the month, based on the value of month, using the switch statement."
