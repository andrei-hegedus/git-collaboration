Flow Control in Java

Flow Control Defines the way code is executed.
In Java it can be implemented with the following mechanisms:
 - if statements
 - for-loops
 - while-loops
 - switch statements

The if-then Statement

The if-then statement is the most basic of all the control flow statements. It tells your program to execute a certain section of code only if a particular test evaluates to true. For example, the Bicycle class could allow the brakes to decrease the bicycle's speed only if the bicycle is already in motion. One possible implementation of the applyBrakes method could be as follows:

public void applyBrakes() {
    // the "if" clause: bicycle must be moving
    if (isMoving){ 
        // the "then" clause: decrease current speed
        currentSpeed--;
    }
}

The FOR statement.

it looks like this:

for(<initialization>; <boolean expression>; <update>) {
   // Statements
}

for(declaration : expression) {
   // Statements
}

 The While-loops 
 
 In most computer programming languages, a while loop is a control flow statement 
 that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The 
 while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.
 

The switch stement

"Unlike if-then and if-then-else statements, the switch statement can have a number of possible execution paths. A switch works with the byte, short, char, and int primitive data types. It also works with enumerated types (discussed in Enum Types), the String class, and a few special classes that wrap certain primitive types: Character, Byte, Short, and Integer (discussed in Numbers and Strings).

The following code example, SwitchDemo, declares an int named month whose value represents a month. The code displays the name of the month, based on the value of month, using the switch statement."
