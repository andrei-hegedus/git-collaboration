In Java it can be implemented with the following mechanisms:
 - if statements
 - for-loops
 - while-loops
 - switch statements

 In most computer programming languages, a while loop is a control flow statement 
 that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The 
 while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.
